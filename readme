this project uses tweepy to acces twitter tweets for a given key word. 
future plans include expanding this feature to make date based queries on the given keyword,
and expanding the number of key words included and excluded from the query.

it then clasifies the languages of the tweets with the goal of picking out the ones writen inspanish for the sentiment analysis. 

Then a sentiment analysis is carried out on the tweets and the results are displayed on a streamlit app.
future plans include, expanding metrics and analysis based on the sentiment analysis, and expanding the analysys to other languages.
